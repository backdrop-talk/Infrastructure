# Infrastructure
Discussion about the nuts-and-bolts that keep Backdrop websites and services up and running.

There come times when we need to discuss ideas around the infrastructure and overhead of the Backdrop project. Whether it's our own in-house servers hosting sites or a third-party service like github that houses our code repo, there are times that things need to be done about the systems that keep us all happy with Backdrop.

## Where to start...

1) If you want to discuss things, head over to the **Discussions** tab.

2) If you want to add or ammend a policy, create an issue in the **Issues** tab.

3) If you want to see the progress of any outstanding issues, check out the **Projects** tab.
